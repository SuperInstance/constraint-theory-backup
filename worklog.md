Task ID: p1-python
Agent: Polish Pass Agent
Task: Final polish pass on constraint-theory-python README

Work Log:
- Analyzed README against 4 HN-focused criteria:
  1. Hook strength (first 5 lines)
  2. NumPy integration value proposition
  3. One-liner appeal (30-second try)
  4. Call to action clarity

Changes Made:

1. **Hook Strength** (Lines 1-4)
   - BEFORE: "Python simplicity. Rust performance. Exact geometry with zero drift."
   - AFTER: "Your floating-point drift ends here. Snap vectors to exact Pythagorean triples."
   - Rationale: Generic marketing → Pain-point driven hook that stops scrollers

2. **Problem Statement** (Line 24)
   - BEFORE: "Your physics simulation gives different results on laptop vs. cluster. This library fixes an entire debugging class."
   - AFTER: "Your physics simulation gives different results on laptop vs. cluster. Your tests flake. Your Monte Carlo won't reproduce."
   - Rationale: Three specific pain points = more relatable

3. **One-Liner Appeal** (Lines 62-67)
   - BEFORE: Verification showed only "states loaded"
   - AFTER: One-liner shows the ACTUAL SNAP happening: `Exact: (0.6, 0.8)`
   - Rationale: Shows the "ah-ha" moment immediately

4. **NumPy Integration** (Lines 122-136)
   - BEFORE: Generic "NumPy Integration" header, buried comparison
   - AFTER: "NumPy Integration — Drop-In Replacement for Normalization" with inline comparison
   - Added: "Your old way: v / np.linalg.norm(v) → floating-point drift"
   - Added: "Your new way: manifold.snap(x, y) → exact everywhere"
   - Rationale: Direct comparison shows migration path

5. **Call to Action** (Lines 372-374)
   - BEFORE: "If your simulation gives different results on laptop vs. cluster..."
   - AFTER: "Stop debugging floating-point drift. Your competitors already did."
   - Rationale: FOMO trigger + clearer action

6. **Minor Polish**
   - Changed "Install from PyPI" → "pip install constraint-theory" (less clicks)
   - Added emoji to star CTA: "[⭐ Star this repo]"
   - Changed "Demos" → "Demo" (singular, less intimidating)

Stage Summary:
README now optimized for HN audience:
- ✅ Hook addresses pain point immediately (floating-point drift)
- ✅ NumPy integration clearly positioned as drop-in replacement
- ✅ One-liner shows the magic (snap in action) in 30 seconds
- ✅ CTA uses FOMO trigger and clear next steps

result = quantizer.quantize(embeddings)  # Unit norm preserved

# Hidden dimensions for exact constraints
k = compute_hidden_dim_count(1e-10)  # k = 34
encoded = encode_with_hidden_dimensions(point, constraints=['unit_norm'])
